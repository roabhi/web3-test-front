# web3-test-front

This is a very simple NFT (ERC-721) minter made as a test just to try how interacting with [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) and live (kind of) smart contracts would be. The tool is live on ~~Rinkeby~~ Goerli testnet so if you want to try it out you would need some faucet tokens first. You can get some here:

[goerli faucet from chainlink](https://faucets.chain.link/)

This is a WIP project as I develop my understanding of how NFT's work and in which ways they can be used, transfered and linked with (real) assets on the blockchain, in this case EVM compatible ones.

## Library

I used [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/ethers.js/v3.0/html/)

## Solidity Contract

[Rinkeby network has been deprecated - only read mode](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xa8358be35294c67403e2bd53a1b958f6188ceb3f)
[Contract redeployed and fully functional on Goerli here](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x92EbA29b65441E64A21B4ed2d7deB91E72B6EbfF#code)
